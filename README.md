# Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster 🚢

This is my solution to the famous Titanic Kaggle competition. The goal is to predict which passengers survived the tragedy using machine learning techniques.

## 📊 Dataset
- The dataset contains information like age, gender, ticket class, etc.
- You can find it on Kaggle: [Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data)

## 📌 What I Did
- Cleaned and handled missing data
- Used `RandomForestClassifier` for prediction
- Did feature engineering (like extracting titles from names)
- Tuned hyperparameters to improve accuracy

## 🔍 Key Features
- Jupyter Notebook with step-by-step explanation
- Model training and evaluation
- Accuracy score on the test set

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 📈 Result
- Public Leaderboard Score: 0.78468

## 📁 How to Run
1. Clone this repo
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook
3. Run all cells

## 💡 Future Improvements
- Try advanced models like XGBoost
- Improve feature engineering
